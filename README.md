# RowHammer Interpreter (RHI)
This repository contains different implementations of the Rowhammer language interpreter presented in my thesis, "Towards automatic analysis of microarchitectural attacks 2023", which can be accessed 
[here](https://hdl.handle.net/10779/uos.24610929.v1). 

There are three implementations of the same interpreter using different approaches.
One uses monads for the interpreter, the second one, utilises sampler techniques in order to implement the interpreter, and last one is plain Haskell implementation.

Please note that each implementation is independent of the others and contains examples of how it can be run.
